# Udacity Portfolio Project

### Mission
This is the Udacity Portfolio project which is part of the Full Stack Nanodegree Program. 
I was given a template of which to mold my design around, but still managed to incorporate part of my personality into the color palette and overall flow of the site. The site is developed to be responsive for different devices and presents a few of my projects completed.
